	! Fixed #15 issue in github (Return precedence error)
	- Closed #2 issue in github (Remove the OLE::Storage_lite dependancy)

		answer for specific errors

v0.30.2   2014-12-25 21:25:32-08:00 America/Los_Angeles

	! Closed #20 in github (pull request for undef FileType message specificity)
	+ Closed #3 in github Move Temp::Dir methods to Archive::Zip in github
		This is a big change since it changes some of the extensibility API's
		It also changes the way the initial file is locked.  It used to unzip the file to a 
		temporory directory and then unlock the file.  Now it holds a lock on the file during the whole read.
	! Closed #18 in github.  The temp dir management is very different
		The failing solo SciTE GUI test 03-temp_dir_bug.t now passes.
